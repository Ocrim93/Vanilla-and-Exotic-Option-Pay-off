# Vanilla-and-Exotic-Option-Pay-off
Monte Carlo program which uses a polymorphic class to determine the pay-off of the Vanilla and Exotic  options to be priced.

How inheritance could be used to implement a PayOff class that is closed for modification but open for extension.

Key ingredients:
  - Using a pay-off Abstract class (as interface) allows to add extra forms of pay-offs without modifying our Monte Carlo routine;
  - By overloading the operator() we can make an object look like a function;
  - const attribute makes our program faster and forces the coder to be aware of which code is allowed to change things and which code cannot;
  - Strike prices and Lower and Upper bound are private data which help us to separate interface from implementation. 


 Virtual method Benefits:
		- Program is much clearer; 
		- Extra functionality dependent on the pyaoff options.
